 * Default policy (ADR-5, revised: the rank-based guard is the only model —

 * directly: Unsafe blocks, Controversial/unparseable goes to review, Safe
 * publishes. Deterministic tiers (allowlist, blocklist/denylist, PII) decide
 * before the guard ever runs and are unaffected by shadow mode.
 *
 * Ships with shadowMode ON: guard-blocks are logged as would-block and
 * published, until the verdict quality is confirmed on live traffic (ADR-4).
