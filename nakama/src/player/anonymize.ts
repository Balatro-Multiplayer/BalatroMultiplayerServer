// three kinds of data as Postgres (the API's player-anonymization gateway):
// - own data goes: the player's own objects (with the account), their logs,
//   runs only they played, pending mirror entries of their own (normal chat,
//   Notice acceptance), their legacy rating claim, lobby checkpoints and group
//   parties that name them.
// - a shared run (one other players played too) names DELETED_PLAYER_ID, one
//   standard id every deleted player shares, so the other players' history
//   stays whole.
// - moderation data names a random anonymous id, which the API also gives
//   the Postgres rows: runs an open report or ban uses (with the player's
//   log), flagged chat and forfeits on their way to Postgres, network bans,
//   and the ban index when the player has a ban record.
