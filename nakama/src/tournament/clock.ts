// The tournament clock: an authoritative Nakama match with no players that
// ticks once a second and, every few seconds, moves along every tournament
// whose due time has come (tournament_due, kept by storage.ts). It lives in
// Nakama itself, so it also runs on Community servers without the API.
//
// It is (re)started by ensureClock, which every tournament RPC calls, and by
// InitModule when Nakama allows it there. If two ever run, the newer one
// stops. A missed tick costs nothing: every RPC catches its tournament up
// first, and the due index keeps everything else.
